Dear DC Python Meetup members,

Thank you for being a member of the DC Python Meetup, brought to you by DC Python. Over the past year, you've helped us fulfill our mission by attending project nights, formal presentations, and more. To help us continue in 2020, we're excited to announce our holiday fundraising campaign.
 
Support DC Python
In addition to running the DC Python Meetup group, we promote and support the research, development and use of Python software in DC, Maryland and Virginia. We support the education of all Python users by organizing and hosting frequent instructional events to foster and facilitate academic research, development and learning as well as professional growth and networking.

Sincerely,
Alex
